            <h1>What is dead Lift?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>The deadlift could very well be the most important movement you learn throughout your lifting career.</li>
                <li>It is a hip-hinge movement that builds the entire posterior chain.</li>
                <li>Stance: Stand with heels hip-width apart, narrower than on squats, and point toes out 15°.</li>
                <li>Foot positioning: Ensure the bar is over the middle of your foot, not too far forward (over the toes) or too close (against the shins).</li>
                <li>Muscle engagement: Primary muscles involved are gluteus maximus, hamstrings, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and soleus.</li>
                <li>Safety: Always prioritize safety by keeping the weight under control and being prepared to drop the bar if necessary.</li>
